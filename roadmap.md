# Release Roadmap

LanguageTool uses a time-based release cycle, with a new release every 
three months. This is a list of upcoming LanguageTool releases. If 
you're working on a major feature, please plan accordingly so the 
feature will be ready a few weeks before release, so that enough time 
remains for testing.
