# Tasks for Language Maintainers

LanguageTool supports [<http://languagetool.org/languages/>   more than 
25 languages], but not all of them have active maintainers. If you want 
LanguageTool to support your language well, consider becoming a 
maintainer. You do *not* need to know a programming language, and you 
do *not* need to be a linguist or grammar expert. A maintainer's tasks 
are:

* Maintain the error detection rules: improve rules to create less 
  false alarms, write new rules to detect new types of errors. How rules 
  work is [documented 
  here](http://wiki.languagetool.org/development-overview).
* Translate the LanguageTool user interface into your language. We make 
  a new release every three months, so translations should also be 
  updated every three months. As our user interface isn't very complex, 
  this is actually not much work (less than 30 minutes every three 
  months).
* Keep track of incoming [issue 
  reports](https://github.com/languagetool-org/languagetool/issues)
* Spread the word about LanguageTool, for example by blogging, or by 
  contacting people who run websites that offer spell and grammar 
  checking, asking them whether they have considered using LanguageTool.

Also, you should

* be an active user of LanguageTool
* have an excellent command of the language you maintain
* know a little bit about XML or have the willingness to learn it (it's 
  easy), so you can manage the error detection rules
* [subscribe to the 
  forum](https://forum.languagetool.org/t/how-to-use-this-forum-like-a-mailing-list/1067) 
  - you don't need to follow all technical discussions, but you should 
  have a general understanding of where LanguageTool is going

Languages in need of a maintainer are Japanese, Swedish, Belarusian, 
Persian [and others](http://languagetool.org/languages/).

## What we Offer in Return

* be part of the team that develops the world's most powerful Open 
  Source proofreading tool (our REST API serves more than 500,000 
  requests per day)
* your name listed as maintainer on http://languagetool.org/languages/ 
  and in the "About" dialog of LanguageTool
* an email address firstname.lastname@languagetool.org

How to become a maintainer? [Subscribe to the 
forum](https://forum.languagetool.org/t/how-to-use-this-forum-like-a-mailing-list/1067), 
start writing or improving some error detection rules, and send them to 
the list or send Github pull requests. If you need help, just ask on 
the list.
